# Upgrade `Vector` API SIMD Acceleration Capability in .NET

**Owner** [Anthony Canino](https://github.com/anthonycanino) 

.NET support for SIMD acceleration through `Vector<T>` API allows developers to transparently harness the power of advanced SIMD ISAs without expert-level knowledge of low-level hardware details and optimization techniques. Given its variable length nature, `Vector<T>` allows to adapt to the most performant SIMD ISA implementation available for the platform. However, internal .NET libraries use `Vector<T>` as a fallback SIMD code path, where hand-optimized intrinsic code paths, e.g, SSE or AVX2, provide more performance due to `Vector<T>` platform-agnostic API. 

This is problematic for a number of reasons:

  1. As new SIMD ISAs are released, .NET developers [Gabe: do we need to make a distinction here between app/library/runtime developers?] must write additional SIMD code paths *per optimized library*, increasing code complexity and maintainence burden. At best, much time has to be dedicated to these libraires; At worst, libraries do not get upgraded for latest hardware advancements.

  2. Hand-optimized intrinsics lock software into a specific ISA, often with fixed thresholds [I'd say here "fixed logic", as presumably the selection procedure may be more elaborate than just checking for a number] for determining when to select a SIMD accelerated codepath for performance gains. In a JIT environment where we can glean [Nitpick: is "glean" too soft a word?  At the time the JIT kicks in, it should have full knowledge of the hardware it's running on, no?] performance characteristics of the underlying platform, intrinsics prevent adapting to the most _performant_ SIMD ISA available for a given _workload_.

In this design document, we propose to extend `Vector<T>` to serve as a vessel for frictionless SIMD adoption, both internal to .NET libraries, and to external .NET developers. As a realization of this goal, we propose the following:

  1. Upgrading `Vector<T>` to serve as a sufficiently powerful interface for writing both internal hardware accelerated libraries and external developer code. 

  2. Introducing `Vector512<T>`, analogous to `Vector128<T>` and `Vector256<T>` but for 512-bit SIMD ISA generation. 

  3. Allowing for `Vector<T>` to select the best available `VectorXX` for the platform, with support for dynamically selecting the vector width based on information available at runtime, e.g,. the size of the `Span` being vectorized.

## Scenarios and User Experience

### `Vector<T>` as an SIMD optimization template

The following code snippet --- taken from the fallback optimization path of UTF16 to ASCII narrowing --- poses problems as the _sole_ SIMD optimization pathway in the ASCIIUtility library. Namely, the check on whether we should vectorize or not will create different performance characteristics depending upon the size the JIT chooses for `Vector<T>`. If `Vector256` is choosen, then buffers with 64 elements and above will be optimized; if `Vector128` is chosen, then buffers of 32 elements and above will be optimized. 


```C#
nuint currentOffset = 0;
uint SizeOfVector = (uint)Unsafe.SizeOf<Vector<byte>>(); // JIT will make this a const

// Only bother vectorizing if we have enough data to do so.
if (elementCount >= 2 * SizeOfVector)
{
  // ...

  Vector<ushort> maxAscii = new Vector<ushort>(0x007F);

  nuint finalOffsetWhereCanLoop = elementCount - 2 * SizeOfVector;
  do
  {
      Vector<ushort> utf16VectorHigh = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector<ushort>>(pUtf16Buffer + currentOffset);
      Vector<ushort> utf16VectorLow = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector<ushort>>(pUtf16Buffer + currentOffset + Vector<ushort>.Count);

      if (Vector.GreaterThanAny(Vector.BitwiseOr(utf16VectorHigh, utf16VectorLow), maxAscii))
      {
          break; // found non-ASCII data
      }

      // TODO: Is the below logic also valid for big-endian platforms?
      Vector<byte> asciiVector = Vector.Narrow(utf16VectorHigh, utf16VectorLow);
      Unsafe.WriteUnaligned<Vector<byte>>(pAsciiBuffer + currentOffset, asciiVector);

      currentOffset += SizeOfVector;
  } while (currentOffset <= finalOffsetWhereCanLoop);

  // ...
}
```

This prevents `Vector<T>` from consistent behavior both internal to .NET libraries and for external .NET developers [I have trouble parsing this... is the inconsistency between the libraries or between library and user code (or both)?]. Particularly with the addition of `Vector512`, workloads that previously would have been optimized would no longer clear the threshold [Should we emphasize this problem?  I mean, "not clearing the threshold" means that the addition of wider vectors would cause previously optimized code to fallback to a less performant variant?]. To aid `Vector<T>` is [should this be "as"?] a single generic SIMD framework, we propose to add a `Vectorize` intrinsic that instructs the JIT to generate _multiple_ SIMD acceleration pathways. 

For example, in the following snippet:

```C#
nuint currentOffset = 0;

// Only bother vectorizing if we have enough data to do so.
if (Vectorize.IfGreater(elementCount, 2 * Unsafe.Sizeof<Vector<byte>>()))
{
  // ...

  Vector<ushort> maxAscii = new Vector<ushort>(0x007F);

  nuint finalOffsetWhereCanLoop = elementCount - 2 * SizeOfVector;
  do
  {
      Vector<ushort> utf16VectorHigh = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector<ushort>>(pUtf16Buffer + currentOffset);
      Vector<ushort> utf16VectorLow = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector<ushort>>(pUtf16Buffer + currentOffset + Vector<ushort>.Count);

      if (Vector.GreaterThanAny(Vector.BitwiseOr(utf16VectorHigh, utf16VectorLow), maxAscii))
      {
          break; // found non-ASCII data
      }

      // TODO: Is the below logic also valid for big-endian platforms?
      Vector<byte> asciiVector = Vector.Narrow(utf16VectorHigh, utf16VectorLow);
      Unsafe.WriteUnaligned<Vector<byte>>(pAsciiBuffer + currentOffset, asciiVector);

      currentOffset += SizeOfVector;
  } while (currentOffset <= finalOffsetWhereCanLoop);


  // ...
}
```

the JIT to generate would generate the following depending upon the availability of the SIMD ISA of the platform:

```C#
// Only bother vectorizing if we have enough data to do so.
if (elementCount >= 2 * Vector512<byte>.Count)
{
  // Execute a Vector512 pathway
  Vector512<ushort> maxAscii = new Vector512<ushort>(0x007F);

  // ...
}
else if (elementCount >= 2 * Vector256<byte>.Count)
{
  // Execute a Vector512 pathway
  Vector256<ushort> maxAscii = new Vector256<ushort>(0x007F);

  // ...
}
else if (elementCount >= 2 * Vector128<byte>.Count)
{
  // Execute a Vector512 pathway
  Vector128<ushort> maxAscii = new Vector128<ushort>(0x007F);

  // ...
}
```

In this way, we can collapse multiple SIMD ISA checks into a single "template" SIMD ISA code which the JIT may expand. We use a new `Vectorize` intrinsic that allows backward compatability with `Vector<T>`, i.e., a `Vectorize` JIT intrinsic instructs the JIT that the code inside its block is a template for multiple vector sizes. If `Vectorize` is not present, `Vector<T>` will generate as a single vector size chosen by the JIT.

### Additional `Vector<T>` Methods for Near-Intrinsic Performance

```C#
public int SumVector(ReadOnlySpan<int> source)
{
  Vector<int> vresult = Vector256<int>.Zero;
  for (int i = 0; i < source.Length; i += Vector256<int>.Count)
  {
    vresult += new Vector<int>(source.Slice(i));
  }

  int result = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < Vector<int>.Count; i++)
  {
    result += vresult[i];
  }

  // Handle tail
  int rem = source.Length % Vector<int>.Count;
  for (int i = 0; i < rem; i++)
  {
    result += source[(source.Length - rem)+i];
  }

  return result;
}
```

The reduction loop will cost much of the performance gain from the vectorized loop. If we use fixed size vectors and hardware intrinsics, we can perform the reduction via horizontal adds, but this locks us to specific SIMD ISAs. Instead, we propose adding methods in these cases, i.e.,

```C#
public int SumVector(ReadOnlySpan<int> source)
{
  Vector<int> vresult = Vector256<int>.Zero;
  for (int i = 0; i < source.Length; i += Vector256<int>.Count)
  {
    vresult += new Vector<int>(source.Slice(i));
  }

  int result = Vector.ReduceAdd(vresult);

  // Handle tail
  int rem = source.Length % Vector<int>.Count;
  for (int i = 0; i < rem; i++)
  {
    result += source[(source.Length - rem)+i];
  }

  return result;
}
```

which will handle the necessary reduction per platform. 

### Vector512<T> Usage

Existing code that utilizes `Vector256<T>` to perform vectorized sum over a span might look something like the following snippet, where `ReduceVector256<T>` is a method that elides the details of a sum reduction of the elements in the vector:

```C#
public int SumVector256T(ReadOnlySpan<int> source)
{
  Vector256<int> vresult = Vector256<int>.Zero;
  for (int i = 0; i < source.Length; i += Vector256<int>.Count)
  {
    vresult += new Vector256<int>(source.Slice(i));
  }

  int result = ReduceVector256T(vresult);

  // Handle tail
  int rem = source.Length % Vector256<int>.Count;
  for (int i = 0; i < rem; i++)
  {
    result += source[(source.Length - rem)+i];
  }

  return result;
}
```

Like the above snippet, the `Vector512<T>` API would function in much the same way, with most of the `Vector256` API simply replaced by `Vector512` methods:


```C#
public int SumVector512T(ReadOnlySpan<int> source)
{
  Vector512<int> vresult = Vector512<int>.Zero;
  for (int i = 0; i < source.Length; i += Vector512<int>.Count)
  {
    vresult += new Vector512<int>(source.Slice(i));
  }

  int result = ReduceVector512T(vresult);

  // Handle tail
  int rem = source.Length % Vector512<int>.Count;
  for (int i = 0; i < rem; i++)
  {
    result += source[(source.Length - rem)+i];
  }

  return result;
}

```

We expect developers who manually write `Vector128<T>` and `Vector256<T>` code to use `Vector512<T>` with minimal effort.

## Requirements

### Goals

1. `Vector<T>` should allow to generate code that reaches performance within some threshold of hand-optimized intrinsics. 

2. In combination with the JIT, `Vector<T>` written code should allow to adapt to the best performance of underlying platform, i.e., the JIT may generate multiple codepaths and thresholds that select at runtime which SIMD ISA to use.

3. `Vector512<T>` should expose at a minimum the same API operations that `Vector128<T>` and `Vector256<T>` expose.

4. `Vector<T>` API surface should include sufficiently expressive methods to reach the first goal above. This may include
